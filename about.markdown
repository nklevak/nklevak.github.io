I am a second year graduate student in the neuroscience area of the [Stanford Psychology](https://psychology.stanford.edu/) department; advised by Russ Poldrack in the [Poldrack Lab](https://www.poldracklab.org/). 

I'm interested in the many factors that impact our learning and focus over time, and am currently working on projects related to cognitive fatigue and effort, task switching, and learning. 

Previously, I received a B.S.E. degree in Computer Science from Princeton University, with certificates in Cognitive Science and Linguistics. There, and for a year afterwards, I worked in the [Niv Lab](https://nivlab.princeton.edu/) as a lab manager and research assistant. I also spent two summers interning at Meta (first on a Facebook team then at FAIR labs).

I'm passionate about education and mental health, and would love to get involved in experiences related to those interests! In my spare time, I love to read, write short stories, and run (slowly)!
